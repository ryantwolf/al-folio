I am interested in machine learning and computer vision research. Right now, I am working with [Professor Shenlong Wang](https://shenlong.web.illinois.edu/) researching 3D reconstruction. Prior to that, I worked with Dr. Oliver Nina at Air Force Research Laboratory on several multimodal computer vision projects. I graduated from Centerville High School in 2020.

In my free time, I love to boulder with my friends and make small projects. I volunteer for Science Olympaid and Science Bowl competitions across the country. I have written tests for the Ohio State University Science Olympiad invitational, and I have helped moderate several Science Bowl tournaments at MIT.
